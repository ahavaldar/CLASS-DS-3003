## Individual Homework

- Upload your Shiny app on [ShinyApps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io).

- Submit your `.Rmd` AND your URL (https://XXXXX.shinyapps.io/XXXXX) on Collab.

- You need to modify the given interactive plot in the following way:

    - Change the control type for "Number of bins" from `selectInput()` to `sliderInput()`. 
    
    - Change the control type for "Bandwidth adjustment" from `sliderInput()` to `selectInput()`.     
    
    - You need to change `inputId` names in `inputPanel()` and some parts inside `renderPlot()` to run Shiny App.


## Individual Homework (Cont'd)

- Don't delete the given interactive plot.

- If you like, you can change the output type from `ioslides_presentation` to `slidy_presentation`.  

- In your submission file, you should include either of the following statements:

   - "I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this assignment."


-  Example: https://youmi.shinyapps.io/A12example/

## Given interactive Plot

```{r}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = seq(10, 30, 5), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(iris$Sepal.Length, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Sepal Length", main = "Histogram and Density of Sepal Length from Iris Data")
  
  dens <- density(iris$Sepal.Length, adjust = as.numeric(input$bw_adjust))
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

## Modified interactive Plot

```{r}
inputPanel(
  sliderInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              min = 10, max = 30, value = 20, step = 5),
  
  selectInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              choices = seq(0.2, 2, 0.2), selected = 1)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(iris$Sepal.Length, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Sepal Length", main = "Histogram and Density of Sepal Length from Iris Data")
  
  dens <- density(iris$Sepal.Length, adjust = as.numeric(input$bw_adjust))
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
